## Problem definition
Which Machine Learning (ML) Model will most accurately predict breast cancer?

## Models used
[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/vfxgb/Z137-Breast-Cancer/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Model.ipynb)

[Support Vector Machine (SVM)](https://github.com/vfxgb/Z137-Breast-Cancer/blob/main/SVM%20Model.ipynb)

[Binary classification](https://github.com/vfxgb/Z137-Breast-Cancer/blob/main/Binary%20Tree%20Model.ipynb)

## Conclusion
Usage of K fold to decrease variance, lessen overfitting 
Stratified K fold is better than the typical K fold 

Based on the accuracy values, Logistic regression (accuracy: 0.933) is the best model for predicting malignant breast cancer.

## Reflections (Lessons learnt)
Usage of K folds 

Usage of stratified K-Folds to improve the K-Folds method 

Logistic Regression 

Linear, Polynomial and Gaussian SVM 

Binary Classification tree
